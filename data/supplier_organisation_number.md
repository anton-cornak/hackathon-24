# Definition
The supplier organisation number is a domestic unique identifier of a company.

# Instructions
In many countries the organisation and VAT numbers are closely connected in some way. For instance, in Denmark the "CVR" number functions as both the VAT and organisation number. The per-country instructions will specify when such a connection exists. If the organisation and VAT numbers are stated separately, despite them being almost equal, please annotate both.

    -- Norwegian Invoice --

    The document states:

    Foretaksregisteret: NO 123 456 789 MVA      <-- This is a VAT number
    Organisasjonsnummer: 123.456.789            <-- This is an organisation number

    So you should annotate:

    supplier vat number: NO 123 456 789 MVA
    supplier organisation number: 123.456.789

Note that you should enter the text as it is stated in the document. So as you can see in the example above, we also included the spaces/periods.

# Where to find it
You will mostly find the supplier organisation number near the supplier information (address and so on) in the document header, or in the footer of the document.
