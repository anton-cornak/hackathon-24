# Definition
An order number is a number that identifies the customer's order.

# Format
Alpha-numeric characters.

For example: "abcd1234", "20220201-1234", "981276345".

# Where to find it
Order numbers are typically found in the beginning of a document.

Frequently you can find the number in a table of document information or in a table of information about the order. It will often be found close to the order date.

Store receipts will typically not contain an order number.

It may be found in the product table in some rare cases. Just ensure that there is only one order number in that case, since some invoices are for multiple orders and we do not support finding multiple order numbers.

# Be aware of this
Some documents will state both an order number for the supplier and for the customer. We are interested in the customer order number. For example, if you see an invoice that has both "our order number" and "your order number", then you should pick "your order number".

You may experience that you can only find a "purchase order number" (or "PO number"). We accept that as the order number in those cases.

We also accept "sales order number" as the order number.

Take care not to confuse the customer number or document number with the order number. It helps to understand a simplified purchasing process in order to understand the difference between customer, document, and order number:

1. A customer reaches out to a supplier by making a purchase order.
    * The supplier creates a customer number if it is a new customer and reuses the customer number if it is a returning customer.
    * The supplier also creates an order number here in order to track the order throughout the rest of the purchasing process.
2. The supplier accepts the purchase order and starts manufacturing the goods.
3. The supplier delivers the goods and sends an invoice to the customer.
    * The invoice contains the customer number and order number from 1.
    * It also has an "invoice number" which is the document number for the invoice.
