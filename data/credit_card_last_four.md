It should only be found in receipts.

A receipt may sometimes mention several cards. For example, a bonus card and a credit card. We are only interested in the last four digits of the credit card.

Sometimes the credit card number may be followed by a hyphen and one or two digits. In this case we are interested in the last four digits before the hyphen.

For example, we want the four bold digits in this case: xxxxxxxxx __dddd__-dd

* XXXXXXXXXXXX1337
