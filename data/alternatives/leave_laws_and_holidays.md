## **Vacation**

Under Slovak legislation, each worker is entitled to:

-   20 vacation days (for those below 32 years)
-   25 vacation days (for those above 32 years or with a child)

**Visma Labs offers an additional 3 days** of leave per year as an employee benefit. We treat these as regular vacation days. **Thus, each employee gets:**

-   **23 vacation days** (for those below 32 years)
-   **28 vacation days** (for those above 33 years or with a child)

It is stipulated that **employees can carry forward up to 5 vacation days** to the subsequent year. Please have open discussions with the employee about their leave plans and if many vacation days remain, encourage them to take some time off.
