**1.** The process of promotion can be initiated by either the employee or the personnel manager.

**2.** HR must be notified about the promotion request and organize a local technical interview with an experienced interviewer. **A technical interview is a mandatory component of every promotion process for juniors advancing to medior and mediors advancing to senior.** (For most technologies, we have proficient interviewers at Visma Slovakia.)

**3.** The outcome of the technical interview is communicated to both the employee and the personnel manager.

**4.** If the result of the technical interview aligns with the employee's current level, the personnel manager sets objectives for the employee and agrees on a review after a certain period. Once the objectives are achieved, the employee undergoes another technical interview.

**5.** If the technical interview is successful, indicating that the employee's technical competence surpasses the level in VOM, the personnel manager contacts HR about the promotion. If the personnel manager is also in favor of the promotion, HR updates VOM and our local database and prepares the necessary documentation.

(Please note, the technical interview demonstrates the employee's technical expertise; for a higher seniority level, the employee must also demonstrate social skills and a positive approach. The evaluation of these abilities is the responsibility of the manager.)
