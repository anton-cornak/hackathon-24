# Definition
The company name of the supplier.

# How to annotate
It should be annotated the same way that it is written in the document.

Remember to include the company type abbreviation at the end. For example, publicly traded companies in Denmark include A/S (short for aktieselskab) in their legal name, so you should include this part when annotating. The document might not include the company type in the name, in which case it should be omitted from the annotation as well.

# Where to find it
We prefer the longer version that includes the company type. This is typically found adjacent to the supplier address. The supplier name can often also be found in the company logo, although that should only be used when the longer version is not available.
