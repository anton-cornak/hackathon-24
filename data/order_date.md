# Definition
The date that an order was placed on by the customer.

# Where to find it
Order dates are typically found in the beginning of a document.

Frequently you can find the order date in a table of document information or in a table of information about the order. It will often be found close to the order number.

Store receipts will most often not have an order date.

# Be aware of this
Take care not to confuse the document date with the order date. They may sometimes be the same dates, but we are only interested in filling in the order date if it is explicitly stated in the document.

It helps to understand a simplified purchasing process in order to understand the difference between document and order date:

1. A customer reaches out to a supplier by making a purchase order. The order date is the date that this happens.
2. The supplier accepts the purchase order and starts manufacturing the goods.
3. The supplier delivers the goods and sends an invoice to the customer.
    * The invoice contains the order date from 1.
    * It also has an "invoice date" (the document date) which is the date that the invoice is sent.
