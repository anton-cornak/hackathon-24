**1.** Promotion process may be initiated by both employee or personal manager.

**2.** HR has to be informed about the promotion request and organize a local technical interview with experienced interviewer. **Technical interview is mandatory part of every promotion process for junior becoming medior and medior becoming senior.** (For most of the technologies we have skilled interviewers in Visma Slovakia)

**3.** The result of the technical interview is communicated to both employee and personal manager.

**4.** If the result of the technical interview matches the current seniority of an employee, personal manager sets goals for an employee and agree on the check after a period of time. When goals are reached, employee undergoes a technical interview again.

**5.** When the technical interview is successful meaning the technical level of an employee is higher than the one he has in VOM, personal manager reaches out to HR regarding promotion. If personal manager is also positive about the promotion, HR makes changes in VOM and our local database, as well as prepare necessary documents.

(Please note, technical interview show technical experience of employee, for higher seniority level employee has to show social skills and good approach as well. Evaluation of these skills is up to the manager.)
