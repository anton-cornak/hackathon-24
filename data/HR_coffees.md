Each of our colleagues has his/her own HR consultant, based on the team he belongs to. Both, our colleague and his/her manager may reach out to HR consultant whenever their support is needed. All HR consultants are also responsible for regular HR coffees with our colleagues.

HR coffee is a discussion between a colleague and his/her HR consultant, focused on satisfaction with the project, relationships and Visma in general.

**Our main goals are:**

-   Increase employee’ satisfaction (respond to employee’s request/needs)
    
-   Inform manager about possible problems in the team
    
-   Prevent our colleague from leaving team/Visma
    

**We are doing HR discussion:**

-   **By the end of the trial period**
    
-   **Once per year with every colleague (may/june)**
    
-   **If manager or our colleague requires**
