# Definition
BIC is short for Business Identifier Code. It is used in international bank transfers alongside with IBAN where BIC is used to identify the bank.

It is also called SWIFT after the organisation that manages BICs.

# Format
It consists of 8 or 11 characters:

* 4 characters used to identify the institution or bank.
* 2 letter country code.
* 2 letters or digits functioning as a location code.
* 3 optional letters or digits to identify the branch.

For example, the Danish bank called Danske Bank has this BIC: DABADKKK.

* *DABA* identifies Danske Bank.
* *DK* states that it is in Denmark.
* *KK* is the location code for Copenhagen.

# Where to find it
A document will say BIC or SWIFT followed by a BIC number.

Some documents have multiple BICs. Each BIC tends to be associated with an IBAN, so you should pick the BIC associated with the IBAN that you pick. See the guide on IBAN for how to pick an IBAN when there are multiple IBANs.
