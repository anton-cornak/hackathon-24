If you have an employee with a performance issue/problem, it is important to **let us - HR know,** as sometime we can be helpful in some way. We can set up a small meeting and talk about the problem.

**Most important is, that our colleague knows about his/her performance issue so be sure that he received feedback**. We recommend setting regular 1on1 meetings with our colleagues where both side have space for the feedback & questions.

When there is an issue in employee's performance, you should create a performance improvement plan.  
**Performance improvement plan must include:**  
\- areas for improvement  
\- time period

In case, performance improvement plan does not work and you no longer want to have an employee in the team, please read the [section Offboarding (part B: Company decided to terminate an employee](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/pages/1h43hlt5l5metqsbqt/Offboarding/1i4memfrr351ud37sh?locale=sk)) and contact our responsible HR consultant about the options.
