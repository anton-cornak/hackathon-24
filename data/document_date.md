# Definition
The date that a document was sent.

Take care not to confuse the document date with the order date. The document date is specific to the document while the order date is the date that the order was placed by the customer. See "Order number" for more information on the difference information specific to the document and information about the order.

A document will sometimes have a print date. While it can be the same date as the document date, this is not the value that we are interested in.

# Where to find it
Document dates are typically found in a table of document information in the beginning of a document.

However, receipts are an exception since dates may be found closer towards the end in those cases.

The document date may be labelled specific to the document type:

* "Invoice date" for invoices.
* "Credit note date" for credit notes.
* "Debit note date" for debit notes.
* Receipts will most often just say "date".

You should look for "date" when it is not labelled specific to the document type.
