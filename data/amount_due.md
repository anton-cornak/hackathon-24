# Definition
The amount that the customer owes the supplier.

This will frequently be the same as the total including VAT, but there are some exceptions to this, e.g. when an invoice has been partially paid in advance.

We also want to annotate credit notes with the amount due, but the amount should be negative for credit notes because it is the supplier who owes the customer money in those cases.

# When to annotate
Annotate the amount due as much as possible. It is perfectly fine to assume that the total including VAT is the amount due when nothing else is stated.

Generally speaking, you should not fill in amount due for receipts. There are some rare exceptions to this rule, but they will usually state that more money are still owed when that is the case.

# Where to find it
The amount due will often be found in one of these places:

* In a summary of the totals. Usually towards the end of the document, but can also occur around the beginning.
* The sum of a product a table.
