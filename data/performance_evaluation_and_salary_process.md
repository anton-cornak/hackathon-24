Information regarding these processes for all team leaders and managers is disseminated through scheduled meetings, during which the individual steps, requirements, and deadlines are clearly communicated. Attendance at these meetings is **crucial** to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the process and to maintain adherence to all deadlines.

During the performance appraisal, managers must evaluate an employee's performance and evaluate the achievement of pre-defined goals. The outcome of this evaluation directly influences potential salary adjustments.

You can evaluate employee in the tool through the ratings:

## **Key reminders:**

1.  Employees should receive feedback on their performance and goal achievement during a dedicated performance review meeting. (If an employee is evaluated as "not meeting expectations" or "far below the expected standard," this must be communicated clearly. Additionally, specific goals for improvement should be established during the meeting.)
2.  We strongly encourage managers to discuss the employee's salary expectations as part of the review process.
3.  It is also recommended to engage in a dialogue about the employee's career aspirations and current seniority, as this could be relevant for potential salary adjustments aligned with their seniority level and salary ranges for seniority levels

## **Salary process**

The salary process follows immediately after the performance evaluation process, and the manager's task is to propose an appropriate increase in the employee's salary according to his performance, achievement of goals and other indicators.

**Key Reminders:**

1.  **Salary Proposal Based on Performance Evaluation**: The employee's salary adjustment is directly linked to their performance evaluation. Higher-rated performance will typically result in a more significant salary increase.
2.  **Key Employee Designation**: If an employee is identified as a "key", he/she will be eligible for a higher salary increase.
3.  **Salary Ranges by Seniority**: [Salary ranges](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/pages/1h43hlt5l5metqsbqt/ContractAmpSalaryConditions/1i6c2576k8lairp88b?locale=sk) for each seniority level are available and should be used as a reference when considering adjustments. If you require information on salary ranges for other positions (e.g., Business Analyst, DevOps Engineer), please contact Slovak HR.
4.  **Promotion Considerations**: Promotion to a higher seniority level may also be part of the salary review process. For further details, please refer to the [promotion process](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/pages/1h43hlt5l5metqsbqt/PromotionProcess/1i4menb6k3m7bn1uh0?locale=sk) and consult with local HR.
5.  **Announcing the Salary Increase**: Schedule a meeting with the employee to communicate the salary increase and discuss their overall satisfaction.
6.  **Post-Announcement Process**: After announcing the salary increases for all Slovak employees on your team, please coordinate with Slovak HR to ensure employees sign the necessary salary amendment documentation.
