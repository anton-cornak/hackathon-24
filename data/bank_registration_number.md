# Definition
Also known as _bank code_ and is often specified in connection with a _bank account number_. The registration number is a number that uniquely identifies a bank. Together with an account number a specific bank account can be completely specified.

# When to annotate
You should always annotate the bank registration number if it is present in a document. Bank registration numbers are mostly present in invoices, credit notes, and debit notes, but rarely in receipts.

Note that this field is only meant for domestic formats. So even though BIC/SWIFT is the equivalent of a bank registration number, this should never go here. Generally speaking, separate bank account and registration number even if they appear in a "bank line". See the country specific instructions for how to make the split.

Note that it is pretty common to ommit leading zeros. So always assume that the specified formats could be shorter than stated.

# Where to find it

Bank registration numbers are usually found together with payment terms in the vicinity of the amount due, or in the footer of the document.
