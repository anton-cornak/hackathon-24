In the past we have launched several iterations of extra local trainings for our colleagues.

**Leadership academy** is a program dedicated to the development of local leaders, team & personal managers.

**Talent management** program serves to develop talents within younger colleagues (junior/medior level)  
Since its start in 2023 we have trained 20 colleagues on soft skills like communication, feedback, presentation, energy management or motivation.

If you feel that you have a team member who could benefit from any of these trainings, please let us know via our HR consultants.
