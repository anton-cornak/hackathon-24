# Definition
Businesses send different types of documents for different purposes. This field identifies what type of document it is.

We support the following document types:

* Credit note
* Debit note
* Invoice
* Receipt

There are some documents that do not fit into the definition of those document types, but are still worth annotating. We set the document type to "Other" in those cases.

# Credit note
Credit notes are issued by the supplier and are used when the supplier owe the customer money.

The need for a credit note can arise in several situations:

* The customer returns goods.
* The supplier is only able to deliver part of the order
* The supplier gives a discount to the customer after sending an invoice.
* And more.

Credit notes also exist because invoices have to be immutable, meaning that they can't be changed once they are sent. Deductions in prices will therefore have to be handled by issuing credit notes, if the price deduction happens after the invoice is sent.

# Debit note
Debit notes can be issued by both the supplier and by the customer. It is used to state that the receiving part owes money to the sender.

A supplier might send a debit note when an invoice has not been paid within the agreed upon due date.

A buyer might send a debit note when returning goods and requesting money back for the returned goods.

Debit notes can also serve as a reminder of payment.

[This page](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debit-note.asp) provides more information about debit notes.

# Invoice
An invoice is sent by the supplier and contains a summary of the goods/services provided, the amounts/totals, and usually also information about when and how to pay.

# Receipt
Receipts serve as a proof of receipt of goods/services and as a proof of payment.

It will typically be easy to identify receipts from physical stores because they are visually very distinguishable. However, receipts are not only used in physical stores. Remember in particular that it might be a receipt even though the document says invoice. Some suppliers are just sloppy with their naming. This is especially happening for receipts of purchases in web shops.
