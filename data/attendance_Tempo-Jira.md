## **ATTENDANCE: Registration of working hours and Approval** 

Each of our colleagues is obligated to log their working hours as well as time off once a month. Regarding the time off - all of our colleagues are said to inform their direct manager as well as their team about their absence.

For registration of working hours we use the Jira tool TEMPO and team specific codes as well as general codes for time-off.

<table><colgroup><col width="93"><col width="307"><col width="200"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td><p><span>ADM-65</span></p></td><td><p><span>Vacation</span></p></td><td><p><span>23/28 days per calendar year</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>ADM-63</span></p></td><td><p><span>Doctor’s visit</span></p></td><td><p><span>7 per calendar year</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>ADM-58</span></p></td><td><p><span>Doctor’s visit with family</span></p></td><td><p><span>7 per calendar year</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>ADM-61</span></p></td><td><p><span>Sick day</span></p></td><td><p><span>3 per calendar year</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>ADM-56</span></p></td><td><p><span>Sick leave</span></p></td><td><p><span>unlimited</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>ADM-47</span></p></td><td><p><span>Special time off (funeral, blood donation etc.)</span></p></td><td><p><span>unlimited</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

All of our colleagues must have their timesheets filled by the 27th day of the month. After that all timesheets must be checked and approved by their direct manager - you.  
  
You need to approve the timesheet of a colleague by the 29th day of the month. After an employee fills his timesheet, you should receive an Approval request email.

After the timesheet is checked, you can approve or reject the colleague´s timesheet.  
  
All managers will receive the total vacation days a person can take at the beginning of each year.  
Other than that, an overview of vacation days(logged as hours) that have been taken you can check in TEMPO with the filter as in the picture below.
