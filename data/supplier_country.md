# Definition
The country that the supplier is located in.

# Where to find it
You can usually find the country of the supplier by looking at the supplier address. This will usually contain the supplier country.

The supplier VAT number will frequently also be useful in identifying the suppler country since VAT numbers of EU-based suppliers are prefixed with the country code. For example, the VAT number of Visma e-conomic is DK29403473 where the DK prefix can be used to locate Denmark. [This page](https://www.iban.com/country-codes) has a table of countries and their (2-letter) codes.

# Be aware of this
Some documents are from a marketplace such as Amazon. The marketplace itself will send the invoice, but they are not the supplier. Look for the provider of the goods/services rather than the marketplace facilitator in those cases. The provider of the goods/services will typically be found by looking for text like "Sold by", "Seller", or "Vendor".

Some non-EU based companies (e.g. Facebook, Google, and Microsoft) sell services within the EU from a legal entity within the EU. This will frequently be Ireland. We are interested in the EU-based legal entity rather than in the non-EU country.
