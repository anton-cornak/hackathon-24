# Definition

A number that identifies the document.

Take care not to confuse the document number with the order number. The document number is specific to the document while the order number can appear across multiple documents since it is used to keep track of the order. See "Order number" for more information on the difference between the two.

Don’t include the leading “#” since it is typically used to say: A number follows.

# Where to find it

Document numbers are typically found in a table of document information in the beginning of a document.

The document number will frequently be labelled specific to the document type:

- "Invoice number" for invoices.
- "Credit note number" for credit notes.
- "Debit note number" for debit notes.
- "Receipt number" for receipts
