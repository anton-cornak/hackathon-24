# Definition
A reference that the customer gives to the supplier. This will typically be the name or email of a person working at the customer, but it can sometimes also be a number (e.g. an employee code).

# Where to find it
We refer to buyer references as those values labelled as *your reference* or *customer reference* or using a similar phrases in other languages.

Buyer references are typically not found in receipts.

# What buyer reference is not
It is understandably easy to mistake this field for places in documents labelled as *reference* or *order reference*, but those are not what we refer to as buyer references. The same goes for *order reference* in other languages - e.g. we do not accept the Spanish *referencia de pedido* either.

Additionally, the buyer reference is not those words labelled as *our reference*.
