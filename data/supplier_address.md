# Definition
The address of the supplier.

# How to annotate
We want all of the address except for the supplier name. This includes the country as well if the address contains a country.

The address should be annotated the same way as it is written in the document, as far as it is possible to do so. Seek in particular to keep words on separate lines if they are written that way in the document.

For example, here is the contact information of Visma e-conomic:

```
Company: Visma e-conomic a/s
Street: Gærtorvet 1-5
City: 1799 København V
CVR: 29403473
Country: Danmark
```

We are not interested in the *Visma e-conomic a/s* part (that is the supplier name). Neither are we interested in the CVR (the supplier organisation number). We copy the remaining part of the address though, so the following becomes the supplier address annotation:

```
Gærtorvet 1-5
1799 København V
Danmark
```

# Which address to pick
Take care not to pick the billing address or delivery/shipping address as these are associated with the customer rather than with the supplier.

Documents sometimes have several supplier addresses. Here are some examples of when that might happen:

* There is a main office and some regional offices.
* There is an office and a warehouse.
* The supplier has offices in different countries.

We are interested in the address that is most specific to who the customer purchased the goods from. For example, if you get handed a receipt in a physical store, then we are more interested in the store address than the office of the store chain.

# Where to find it
Supplier addresses tend to be found in the document footer, although it may also appear in the header.
