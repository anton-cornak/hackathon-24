# Definition
The amount that the customer has paid to the supplier.

For receipts the amount paid should be the cost of the goods. This is not necessarily the same as what the customer would hand over to the store in the case of physical receipts. Say that the price of goods are 95 DKK, but the customer hands over a 100 DKK bill and gets back 5 DKK in cash. We consider the amount paid to be 95 DKK not the 100 DKK.

# When to annotate
We always want to annotate the amount paid in receipts. The only exception to this is when the total is obscured - for example when the receipt is cropped.

Amount paid can also occur in other document types besides from receipts, but it is not as common. Generally speaking, you should only annotate the amount paid when the document states what has already been paid.

# Where to find it
The amount paid will often be found in a summary of the totals. Usually towards the end of the document, but can also occur around the beginning.
